## Introduction

FrozenBoot aims to become a stable, user-friendly and feature rich x86 bootloader. It will be usable
with custom kernels, through a simple API, or through multiboot2 support. But it can also be used as
a bootloader for most of the available Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian).
Not only that, but it will also provide various utilities to diagnose your system, or customize it
through a user-friendly interface.

For now, the project is still in a very early phase, but we except to be able to boot common Linux-based
distributions soon.

## Build

### Get the source code

The main repository [`frozenpeach-dev/bootloader`](https://github.com/frozenpeach-dev/bootloader) contains all
of the required files to build a minimal standalone version of the bootloader.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/frozenpeach-dev/bootloader.git
cd bootloader
```

### Install the latest Rust toolchain (Linux or macOS)

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Install the required components

Before this step, you might need to reload your shell environment after installing the Rust toolchain.

```shell
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview --toolchain nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
```

### Build FrozenBoot

You can now build the project, by changing directory to the `build/` directory that contains all the
necessary build tools.

```shell
cd build/
cargo run
````

### (Optional) Install qemu

Use your package manager to install [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/download/#source) if you want to run the bootloader.

```shell
qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=boot.img
```

## Architecture

The repository is built with the following file structure:
- `build/`: contains the necessary tools to build the project
- `src/`: source files
  - `bios/`: BIOS-related utilities (such as SMBIOS)
  - `fs/`: File system / partition scheme code
  - `fzboot/`: Main bootloader code, contains the Kernel API
    - `mbr/`: Bootloader entry, contained in the disk MBR
    - `real/`: real-mode entry ("second stage"), loaded just after the MBR
    - `main/`: protected-mode entry, loaded after switching from real mode
    - `...`: feature-specific source files (`time`, `irq`)
  - `io/`: Input-output device management code
  - `mem/`: contains memory-management related code
  - `network/`: contains network management code
  - `video/`: contains FrozenBoot's graphic code.
  - `x86/`: architecture-specific code
