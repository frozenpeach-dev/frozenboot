# POD Enums
[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/pod-enum.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/pod-enum)

This crate implements rust enums which are plain-old-data that can be taken from any value, by
inserting an "Unknown" option to cover anything that isn't an actual variant's discriminant.

See [the documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/pod-enum/latest) for more details.
