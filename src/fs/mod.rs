//! File-system related code.
//!
//! Contains the implementations of various common file systems, such as `ext4`, `fat12`, `fat16`,
//! `fat32` as well as common utilities when working with files or directory.
//!
//! [`File`] and [`Directory`] are the most general representation of a file and a directory
//! respectively. They can be used independently of the file system of the partition we are
//! currently working with.
//!
//! Most of the utilities are designed to work with a `global_allocator`, to store files metadata,
//! but some low level primitives might not need one.
